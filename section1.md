# Section 1: Critiquing LionGuard

Read through our paper on LionGuard, “LionGuard: Building a Contextualized Moderation Classifier to Tackle Localized Unsafe Content”, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10995).

## Questions

### a. Why are low-resource languages challenging for natural language processing and large language models? Discuss this with reference to tokenisation.

### b. What implications does this paper have for the development of safety guardrails for LLMs in countries with low-resource languages?

### c. Why was PR-AUC used as the evaluation metric for LionGuard over other performance metrics? In what situations would a F1-score be preferable?

### d. What are some weaknesses in LionGuard’s methodology?
